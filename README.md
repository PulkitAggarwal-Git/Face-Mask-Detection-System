This project is a "Face Mask Detection System" made using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is capable of predicting whether a person has worn a face mask or not with an accuracy of 91.73 %. 

Key features of the project:

1. Detection from images.
2. Uses a deep learning architecture for prediction.

How it works:

1. Dataset Preparation - The model was trained on a dataset containing labelled images of people with and without masks.

2. Model Architecture - A CNN model was designed for this task.

3. Prediction - The trained model classifies image into two classes:
    a. With mask - People wearing mask
    b. Without mask - People without mask
